Your Law is a Lamp
Based on Proverbs 6:20-29
2024
Josiah Hamm

God, your law is a lamp that separates night and day
Your character exposed through an eloquent display

Your law is the light that guides my feet, prone to wander
Everlasting way of life,
The lord who comes to conqueror

I praise your perfect character, the mold of all things good
You sanctify saints daily as your royal priesthood

Satan attacks from every angle – mouth full of lies
But the sword of the spirit gives me faith and clear eyes

Passive or active– the snake’ll getcha either way
So saints flee the smell of the fallen angel’s bouquet

An angel of light– it offers hedonistic bliss
But the halo turns to horns when I seek righteousness

The fire will scorch, and the coals will burn
But my life is in the hands of one whose mercy I couldn’t earn
