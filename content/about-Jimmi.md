In this post, I'm going to detail the overall strategy of Jimmi, as well as some specifics of certain mechanisms.

Firstly, If you haven't seen the game reveal for the 2024 game you can view it now.

<iframe width="928" height="522" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9keeDyFxzY4" title="2024 FIRST Robotics Competition CRESCENDO presented by Haas Game Animation" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

As you can see here, the game has two main objectives, score notes into the speaker/amp, and climb on the chain. the trap also exists as a way to score point, but so few teams used it, that it's barely worth talking about.

firstly, I'm going to just link all of the parts of the robot
