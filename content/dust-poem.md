Dust
Josiah Hamm
Jul 27, ‘24

<br>

What is new in this cemetery queue?

What is novel on this big blue marble?

<br>

I hold dust in my hand, like miniscule grains of sand

the dust saw me live, and will see me die

and my parents, and theirs, and theirs, and theirs

<br>

the dust has seen the night sky fly by

Light and dark, the cycle sighs

<br>

Kings and kingdoms rise and fall

Kings turn dust into bricks

Kings turn bricks into dust

In the end, only dust remains

<br>

Men toil over their work

they draw, and plan, and build, and fix

they sew, and reap, and heal, and kill

Then to the dust, to be forgotten

<br>

What is new in this cemetery queue?

What is novel on this big blue marble?

<br>

trees grow, and fall, and rot, and grow again

the rot will break it all down into dust

<br>

the strong oppress the weak

they aren’t evil, their future’s just as bleak

they’ll be joined together in the dust

<br>

the powerful control the powerless

the scepter changes shape,

but the name of the game remains the same

even scepters are lost to the dust

<br>

books are written and burned

Knowledge accepted and spurned

But the real truth has never changed once

Every fact and err was already there

— just buried deep in the dust

So hey, what’s new in this funeral queue?

Tell me what’s novel on this big blue marble?

<br>

Nothing is new in this funeral queue

Nothing is novel on this big blue marble

<br>

Look above, look out, look through this material plane

For everything here is dust
