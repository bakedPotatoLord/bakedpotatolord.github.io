Dust
Josiah Hamm
Jul 27, ‘24

What is new in this cemetery queue?
What is novel on this big blue marble?

I hold dust in my hand, like miniscule grains of sand
the dust saw me live, and will see me die
and my parents, and theirs, and theirs, and theirs

the dust has seen the night sky fly by
Light and dark, the cycle sighs

Kings and kingdoms rise and fall
Kings turn dust into bricks
Kings turn bricks into dust
In the end, only dust remains

Men toil over their work
they draw, and plan, and build, and fix
they sew, and reap, and heal, and kill
Then to the dust, to be forgotten

What is new in this cemetery queue?
What is novel on this big blue marble?

trees grow, and fall, and rot, and grow again
the rot will break it all down into dust

the strong oppress the weak
they aren’t evil, their future’s just as bleak
they’ll be joined together in the dust

the powerful control the powerless
the scepter changes shape,
but the name of the game remains the same
even scepters are lost to the dust

books are written and burned
Knowledge accepted and spurned
But the real truth has never changed once
Every fact and err was already there
— just buried deep in the dust
So hey, what’s new in this funeral queue?
Tell me what’s novel on this big blue marble?

Nothing is new in this funeral queue
Nothing is novel on this big blue marble

Look above, look out, look through this material plane
For everything here is dust
