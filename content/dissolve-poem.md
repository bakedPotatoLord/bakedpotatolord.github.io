Have you ever seen a man dissolve
Josiah Hamm
4/13/25

Have  you ever seen a man dissolve
softly, his ions float apart
once a crystal tower now a puddle

the rain splats against the walls of the crystal palace, 
it drags the molecules down and into the darkness below
what he believed in so tightly is melting.

the orifice has opened, and the solvent is spewing
the man knew this day was coming
God saw it from days past

the crystal palace was once strong,
immovable by wind or weapon
It thought itself great. 

through great firestorms it prevailed, 
through rockslides and tornadoes
the moon still shone on it's silvery spires

now, as the palace falls,  it becomes as nothing
The rain breaks it down to its tiniest pieces.
the man knows he is dissolving, and feels it

the tower has no soul but it seems helpless in this state
perhaps the tower is the real victim of the storm's wrath
the man is dissolving in a storm from the mouth of God

something is left in the slurry
god has made his will come to pass
I am a man, and I have dissolved
