It is 6/20/2024, at 9:27 PM and Iran and Israel are shooting missles at each other.

According to the [AP](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-iran-war-latest-06-15-2025-291df01b03179cd414db21ca33791b39), 

>Iran’s health ministry says 224 people have been killed since Israel’s attack began Friday.
>Spokesman Hossein Kermanpour said on social media that 1,277 other people were hospitalized, and asserted that over 90% of the casualties were civilians.
>Israel has said 14 people have been killed there since Friday and 390 others wounded.

It isn't super pertinent, but it's worth noting that israel's "iron dome" has been incredibly effectve at intercepting missles,
as evidenced by this graph.

## MAD doesn't always work

I don't like it when people die and suffer. I want to live in a world with less death and suffering.

When I was a child, I learned about the wars of the past, and always assumed that those were relics of a bygone era.
I assumed that humanity had evolved past that, and somehow we had become more than the sensless tribalistic brutes that I viewed that came before as.
the past me was deffinetly quite idealistic, and lacked context. I thought that when a person became an adult, they lost all the emotional thinking and harmful desires,
becoming a beacon of thougtful kindness and compassion.

I eventually learned in 5th grade about the nuclear programs, and the concept of mutually ensured destruction. It was a dissapointing concept, but also a hopeful one. on the one hand, It meant that the relative global peace that I perceived (from 2006 to 2016) was because of fear of retaliation, not collaboration and compassion. on the other, it gave me hope that wars could finally stop happening. 
I understood that even with nuclear arms, proxy wars had taken place, but I assumed that to be a symptom of the cold war, which was over. The USSR had been toppled, the berlin wall had fell, right? 

you could imagine my dissapointment when in the early 2020s, russia invaded ukraine, and hamas entered israel, launching grinding wars that have taken millions of lives thus far, and are not looking like they will stop soon.

My understanding of the [M.A.D.](  TODO: ADD LINK ) principle had a critical flaw, it didn't account for non-nuclear powers. M.A.D only works if every government has the capability to destroy the infastructure of every other government.

I think that this problem is one that humanity is yet to solve. in the long term, I see 2 possible futures. In the first, the current nuclear powers gobble up their surrounding nations, and form larger ones (probably through violent means). in the second, nuclear proliferation becomes widespread, so that all the countries either get a nuke, or become military allies with one that does. 

## All About the NPT (not the fitting)

For those of you who don't know, there are currently 6 countries that own nuclear arsenals. these include the United States, Russia, China, Pakistan, India, Israel, and North Korea

TODO: nuclear arsenal image

To fully understand how we got here, and need to go back to the piece of international legislation that keeps this world order in check. 
it's called the NPT, or [nuclear non-proliferation treaty]().


- who signed it, and who didn't

## the NPT in practice

we're chill with the non-signing countries having nukes. whys that?

- what north korea did

- yemen is a cautionry tale of what happens when you give up nukes


## why i care

we are called to "love our enemies". when I hear conservatives using the bible to justify murder, it disgusts me

- trump is considering a land invasion. I have a friend who is a navy service member.

- I have a friend who is an iranian immigrant, and has family in iran. this war is israel's, becase they want to destroy iran.
- why does israel want to destroy iran? I'm so confused.

I fear the status quo causes immense unnessecary suffering for israelis and iraquis
- if iran continues not having a nuke, 
 they will be bullied until the end of time by a nation holding all the cards (israel)


## The Thesis (A christian argument for nuclear accelerationism)

- I'm going to start with the assumption that israeli lives have the same weight as iraqui and all other lives.
there's a suprising amount of people that wouldn't agree with this.

- if iran gets a nuke, israel leaves them alone, and respects them

- I think we would start treating iran like north korea. we don't need to like them, but we will always respect their territory.

in this situation, i think I prefer a world where iran announces that It has a nuke, and will use it if missles do not stop within 24 hrs. 

stability is achived.
