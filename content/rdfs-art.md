In July of 2024, I decided to try my hand at computer graphics art again. I have some experience with `HTML Canvas` and `HTMLCanvasRenderingContext`, so I was going to need to either build for the web, or learn computer graphics in a different language. It would have been a good idea to learn how to use GPU shaders or something, but I wanted to work with something that I already knew. Even so, I felt bad about using a CPU to render my art, so I went about looking for something that could not be parelizable at all. The first thing that came to mind was an algorithm based around depth/breadth first search.

I've already done some work with BFS, actually, and it had some pretty nice results.
